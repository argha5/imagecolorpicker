# Privacy Policy for ColorPickPro

**Last verified:** January 7, 2026

## Introduction
ColorPickPro ("the Extension") is a color picking tool designed to run locally on your browser. We respect your privacy and represent that we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any user data.** 
*   No personal information (name, email, etc.) is collected.
*   No browsing history is tracked or transmitted.
*   No website content is sent to external servers.

## Permissions Usage
The Extension requires specific permissions to function:

1.  **activeTab & Scripting**: Used solely to inject the color picker overlay and magnifier into the current webpage when you activate the tool. This allows you to select pixels on your screen.
2.  **Storage**: Used to save your preferences (theme, copy format) and your *local* color history. This data stays on your device (synced via your Chrome account if enabled, but not accessible to us).
3.  **Context Menus**: Used to add the "Pick color" shortcut to your right-click menu.
4.  **Host Permissions (<all_urls>)**: Required to allow the color picker to work on any website you visit. We do not run scripts on pages unless you explicitly activate the picker.

## Third-Party Services
This Extension operates entirely client-side and does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services.
